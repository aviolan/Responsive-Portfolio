                <p class="about">I go by Andrew, Drew, or Andy. Born in Pasadena, CA and raised in San Francisco.
                I went to SFSU, and currently work at a Biotech Company in South San Francisco. I've decided
                to take coding bootcamp in order to change up my career and see what else is out there. I would 
                really like to work for a tech company because I enjoy computers, working collaboratively, and innovating.
                </p>
                <p class="about">Hobbies of mine include: Watching a lot of TV, movies, drinking craft beer, and going to OrangeTheoryFitness with my wife.
                Some of my favorite breweries are: The Rare Barrel, Fieldwork Brewing Co., Alvarado Street Brewery, Russian River, and Calicraft.
                I watch a lot of movies and television too. Some of my favorite movies include: Aladdin, Office Space, and Shaun of the Dead. I also watch
                a lot of television, basically I'm a screen junkie.
                </p>
                <p class="about">I also enjoy going to concerts, hiking, playing video games, mahjong, and poker.</p>
